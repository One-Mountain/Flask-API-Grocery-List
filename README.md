# Flask-API-Grocery-List
A flask project using python to create a grocery list of items to get. 
Follows a tutorial from Jake Rieger following the steps in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1RJmh_OqeA&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org
Or in this repository: https://github.com/jakerieger/FlaskIntroduction
Modified to get items from a grocery list as well as their quantities. 

Motivation: to create a list for items that run out from a household infrequently. Eventually for the program to find patterns in items and how frequently they are added to the list to make suggestions.
